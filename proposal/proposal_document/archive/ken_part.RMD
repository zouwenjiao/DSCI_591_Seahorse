## Milestones:
Our project milestones are centered around 2 weeks dedicated each to the Optimisation and Predictive objectives from mid May to Mid June, with proper handover by end June. For more details, please refer to the appendix.
 
## Project Success and Deliverables:
By the end of the capstone, we want to recommend the best momentum indicator rule based on either portfolio percentage return or precision rate of trades. We also want to create a model that can predict if the primary oscillator trade signals will be profitable or not. All reproducible work will be handed over to Seahorse Strategies.
